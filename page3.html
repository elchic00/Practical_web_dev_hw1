    <h4>I worked with my father as a General Contractor for half of my life. We did residential work such as building
        kitchens, bathrooms, decks, and much more.<br/>
        To the left is a picture of me halfway done with a small Azek deck.
        In the middle is my dad almost finished with a Gazebo, and then there's "Rambo" installing a heated kitchen floor.</h4>
