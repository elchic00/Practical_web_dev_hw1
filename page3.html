    <h3>I worked with my father as a General Contractor for half of my life. We did residential work such as building
        kitchens, bathrooms, decks, and much more. This is my dad, almost finished with a Gazebo we built in
        Amityvile Harbor, and "Rambo" installing a heated kitchen floor.</h3>
